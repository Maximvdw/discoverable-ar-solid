\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We presented a solution enabling the collaboration and sharing of personal augmented reality~(AR) environments by using Solid Pods. Our solution allows these personal AR spaces to be discoverable within the physical space that these environments are augmenting by means of semantic beacons that advertise a URI~\cite{10.1145/3627050.3627060}. While our proposed solution allows users to choose which collaborators to accept for the environment through the inbox system, it is currently impossible to accept individual contributions from a single collaborator. Future work might address this issue by applying crowdsourcing techniques~\cite{10.1007/978-3-642-41338-4_17} to the data that is produced by other users.

While we focused on the passive discovery using BLE advertisements to enable seamless discovery of the linked data, similar architectures can be designed using other discovery methods such as a QR-code on the door of the environment. 

In the future, we might evaluate the performance differences between keeping multiple \textit{versions} of a virtual environment in different Pods (as proposed in our solution) versus using a stream of events that indicate changes to the environment, similar to the proposed work in~\cite{01H1940MY7FSFV0W0J44E3CCX7}.
